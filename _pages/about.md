I am **Jehoon Chung**, a finance graduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My research focuses on corporate and household finance, with a particular emphasis on how environmental risks affect financial decision-making and real economic outcomes.

My current project, "Guaranteeing Home Insurance: Evidence from Californiaâ€™s Wildfire Safety and Recovery Act", examines how the availability of home insurance influences household credit and mortgage outcomes while addressing potential market challenges.

Previously, I wrote my master's thesis at Korea University, "The Real Effects of Green Corporate Restructuring", which investigated how heightened environmental risks drive corporate divestitures and the implications of these decisions on firm value and sustainability outcomes.
