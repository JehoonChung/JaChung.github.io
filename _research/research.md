### Guaranteeing Home Insurance: Evidence from California’s Wildfire Safety and Recovery Act
Despite the growing volatility in the homeowner insurance market driven by climate disasters, little is known about how insurance availability affects households. This paper exploits the exogenous, zip-code-level variation in insurance cancellations introduced by California’s Wildfire Safety and Recovery Act (Senate Bill 824) to examine the effects of guaranteed insurance coverage on household credit outcomes. Using a difference-in-differences design with multiple treatments, I compare households in zip codes protected by SB 824 to those just outside its coverage. I hypothesize that guaranteed insurance reduces delinquency and bankruptcy, with stronger effects on low-credit-score households or those with greater damage. However, these are followed by long-term challenges, including a decrease in local insurance supply and rising premiums. These market adjustments lead to increased underinsurance, disproportionately affecting low-income households and exacerbating financial inequalities. 

### The Role of Environmental Risks in Corporate Financial Policies
This paper examines the mechanisms and consequences of environmentally motivated asset sales. Using a sample of 4,879 U.S. plants reported by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from 2011 to 2020, my study finds robust evidence that plants owned by environmentally risky firms under heightened regulatory stringency are 5 to 11 percentage points more likely to be sold. This effect is pronounced in emission-intensive plants that are associated with financially constrained firms, state enforcements, and low divestiture costs. Furthermore, selling firms enjoy higher compensations in firm value and operating performance compared to non-selling firms, while I find no evidence of agency or greenwashing motives in plant sales. On the other hand, sold plants tend to deteriorate workplace safety, employee health, and abatement efforts, which translates to aggravated local sustainability conditions.
